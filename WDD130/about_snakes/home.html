            <h2>Venomous Snakes</h2>
            <section class="glass">
                <p><b><i>Venomous Snakes</i></b> are species of the suborder Serpentes that are capable of producing venom, which they use for killing prey, for defence, and to assist with digestion of their prey.  The venom is typically delivered by injection using hollow or grooved fangs, although some venomous snakes lack well-developed fangs. Common venomous snakes include the <i>families Elapidae, Viperidae, Atractaspididae</i>, and some of the <i>Colubridae</i>.  The toxicity of venom is mainly indicated by murine LD50, while multiple factors are considered to judge the potential danger to humans. Other important factors for risk assesment include the likelihood that a snake will bite, the quantity of venom delivered with the bite, the efficiency of the delivery mechanism, and the location of a bite on the body of the victim. Snake venom may have both <i>neurotoxic</i> and <i>hemotoxic</i> properties.  There are about 600 venomous snake species in the world.</p>

            <h2>Non-Venomous Snakes</h2>
            <section class="glass">
                <p>There are more than 3,000 species of snakes on the planet and they're found everywhere except in Antarctica, Iceland, Ireland, Greenland, and New Zealand. About 600 species  are venoumous, and only 200 - seven percent - are able to kill or significantly wound a human.  Non venomous snakes, which range form harmless garter snakes to the not so harmless python, dispatch their victims by swallowing them alive or constricting them to death. whether they kill by striking with neom or squeszing, nearly all snakes eat their foods whole, in sometimes astoundingly large portions. Almost all snakes are covered in scales and as reptiles, they're cold blooded  and must regulate their body temperature externally. Scales serve several purposes: They trap moisture in arid climates and reduce friction as the snake moves. There have beeen several species of snakes discovered that are mostly scaleless, but even those have scales on their bellies. </p>

            <h2>Constrictors</h2>
            <section class="glass">
                <p>
                    A constricting snake like a boa or a python kills its prey by Constriction and not suffocation.  It uses the momentum of its strike to throw coils around it's victim's body. Then, it squeezes. Every time the prey exhales, the snake squeezes a little more tightly. Soon, the victim can breathe no more. How does the snake know when to stop squeezing you may ask?  Scott Boback form Dickinson College has the answer.  Through its thick coils, a boa can sense the tiny heartbeats of its prey.  when the heart stops, the snake starts to relax. If these large reptiles really killed by suffocation then the prey/victim would take a longer time to die. However, the speed at which the victims died piqued the interest of some scientists and they found that at the moment of constriction, the arterial pressure goes down, the venous pressure goes up causing circulation to stop and cutting off oxygen supply.  This causes the victims heart to beat more and more irregulary causing cardiac arrest.
